Before we even met my life was depressing only focusing on studies and didn't have much time on having fun with friends its because i never had true friends from the start, but when I met you, you were like a sister/brother/mother anything i could think of, well one word to describe you is that you are my first *True Friend*! And It was my first time having a crush as well HAHAHA even today you are still the one I admire but anyways I just hope that you won't forget your friends, families, etc.! </p>
